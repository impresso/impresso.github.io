[Fake News Quiz](https://impresso-project.ch/fakenews/)

These fake news articles were created using the [GPT2 language model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) which we trained on French language historical newspaper texts. The quiz was presented during our [ForumZ online event on historical newspapers](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/de/forum-z/forum-z-goes-online-digitised-newspapers-edition)
