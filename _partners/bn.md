[//]: # (As a memory institution of the Swiss Confederation, the Swiss National Library (SNL) is ready to address new digital realities and willing to promote innovative digital scholarship practices. Since 2006, the SNL has been digitising its collections and making them available online, with a strong emphasis on serials and the press, for which there is significant user demand. In collaboration with cantonal libraries and publishers, the Swiss National Library set up a platform for online newspapers in 2011, recently improved and refactored: [e-newspaperarchives.ch](https://www.e-newspaperarchives.ch/). It also actively supported the DHLAB’s project based on Le Temps digital archives, which resulted in a new interface for the journal’s historical archives,[www.letempsarchives.ch](http://www.letempsarchives.ch)
[//]: # (Role: The SNL will provide the consortium with access to digitised newspapers and periodicals, offer information and comments on the current status and requirements of its platform and provide feedback on the prototypes developed by the consortium. It will also take part in workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians) and text miners will share and exchange experience, and it will benefit from the enrichment of newspaper content and the availability of open-source prototypes.Participants**: Marie-Christine Doffey (Director), Liliane Regamey (Head of User Services)")
