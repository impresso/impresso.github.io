[//]: # ([www.bnl.public.lu](http://www.bnl.public.lu/fr/index.html) &mdash;  The National Library of Luxembourg has been addressing the digital challenge for more than a decade, both as a heritage library and as the coordinator and service provider of the bibnet.lu network of Luxembourg libraries, including the library of the University of Luxembourg. The BnL started digitising its heritage collections in 2002 and since then has been continuously adapting its specifications and methods to reflect changing user requirements and available technologies. Conservation issues and growing demand from researchers and the general public meant that priority was given to the digitisation of the Luxembourg press. To date, 510,000 pages with text recognition and 200,000 pages in image mode are available on the BnL’s website  [www.eluxemburgensia.lu](http://www.eluxemburgensia.lu).Role**: The BnL will support the project by providing the enriched full-text data of its digitised newspaper and periodical collection, which spans the mid-19th to the 20th century. The BnL will share information on the development of its current portal and its aims and plans for data enrichment, while also giving feedback on the new prototypes developed by the project. It hopes to identify opportunities for the improvement of its existing portal, which is scheduled to undergo a technological and functional overhaul. The BnL will also provide input about the process of applying improvements developed by the project to its digital collections. The institution is willing to participate in workshops and conferences dealing with questions raised by the project.)
