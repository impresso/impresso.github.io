Founded in 2016,the C2DH focuses on the study of digital history, contemporary European and Luxembourgish history and public history. The centre promotes interdisciplinary research with a particular emphasis on developing and critically reflecting on new digital methods and tools, and embraces digital methods in its research, teaching and publications (e.g. the Journal of Digital History). C2DH has unique expertise in participatory design and development of methodologically reflected research software like impresso, histograph and DHARPA as well as widespread asset management tools (Zotero, Tropy).

C2DH has accumulated extensive experience in the design and development of methodologically reflected research software for the exploration and analysis of historical data. Within the project, C2DH is responsible for the participatory design and development of user interfaces, several case studies in digital history research and the coordination of dissemination activities.
