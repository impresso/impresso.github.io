Founded in 2016,the C²DH focuses on the study of digital history, contemporary European and Luxembourgish history and public history. The centre promotes interdisciplinary research with a particular emphasis on developing and critically reflecting on new digital methods and tools, and embraces digital methods in its research, teaching and publications (e.g. the Journal of Digital History). C²DH has unique expertise in participatory design and development of methodologically reflected research software like impresso, histograph and DHARPA as well as widespread asset management tools (Zotero, Tropy).

C²DH has accumulated extensive experience in the design and development of methodologically reflected research software for the exploration and analysis of historical data. Within the project, C²DH is responsible for the participatory design and development of user interfaces, several case studies in digital history research and the coordination of dissemination activities.
