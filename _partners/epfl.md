Founded in 2012, the DHLAB focuses on computational approaches for processing, accessing and studying large cultural heritage objects. Its research explores a variety of fields including linguistics, literature, history, art history and architecture, supported by methods from computer science, computer vision,natural language processing, geographic information science and web development. The DHLAB develops methods and softwares for information extraction and mining of historical texts, for transcribing and processing ancient documents and for reconstructing and visualising geographical spaces.

The DHLAB contributes expertise in the acquisition of sources (data sharing agreements, copyright management and data transfer), the development of text mining techniques (especially NE and image processing), the design, implementation and deployment of the integrated technical framework (data management, modelling and infrastructure), the organisation of shared tasks and computational work on historical case studies.
