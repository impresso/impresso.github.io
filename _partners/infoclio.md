[//]: # ([www.infoclio.ch](https://www.infoclio.ch/) &mdash; infoclio.ch is the professional portal for the historical sciences in Switzerland. It was created on the initiative of the Swiss History Society (SSH) and the Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences (SAHS). Its objectives are to develop a digital infrastructure for the historical sciences in Switzerland, to increase the visibility of Swiss historical research on the Web and to facilitate access to digital tools and methods for researchers in the humanities. Role infoclio will work in close collaboration with the consortium on tasks related to the interplay between computer scientists and historians and the design and reception of digital interfaces for the exploration of historical data. More precisely, infoclio will participate in workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians) and text miners discuss and exchange views. It will be responsible for preparing and running the second and fifth workshops on prototypes and epistemological issues and the sixth workshop on the final evaluation of developed systems (see project timeline)Participants\*\*: Enrico Natale (Managing Director)

<!---Besides, infoclio will help to identify opportunities for the improvement of existing portals in order to promote innovative digital scholarship practices; support the investigation of the potentials of digital approaches; encourage the improvement of digital literacy; co-design computational tools for the exploration of historical sources, and identify and serve user needs.-->
