[www.letemps.ch](https://www.letemps.ch/) &mdash;  *Le Temps*, the leading newspaper in French-speaking Switzerland, was launched in March 1998. Its predecessors, the *Journal de Genève* and *La Gazette de Lausanne*, played an important role in the history of the region in the last 200 years, with the first archive dating back to 1 February 1789. Ten years ago, the management team at *Le Temps* therefore decided to digitise and make accessible its entire historical archives. The process involved the Swiss National Library, several sponsors and many years of work. In 2016, the [www.letempsarchives.ch](www.letempsarchives.ch) website was completely redesigned with one objective in mind: making the archives as accessible as possible to the general public.

**Role**: *Le Temps* will provide access to its digitised archives and actively support the design of the historical newspaper exploration interface by giving suggestions and feedback on prototypes developed by the consortium.

**Participants**: Gaël Hurlimann (Editor-in-Chief of Digital Content).
