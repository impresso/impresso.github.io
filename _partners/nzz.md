[www.nzz.ch](https://www.nzz.ch/) &mdash; Since 1780 the NZZ has provided its readers with mainly political and economic information. With the emergence of the internet the NZZ started to develop digital information channels, and it will soon be switching to a digital-only product offering to reflect changing user behaviour. Part of this strategy involves transforming the entire paper archive to a digital archive (via scanning/OCR methods).

**Role**: NZZ supports *impresso* by giving full access to all existing digital newspaper assets from 1780 to 1950 (strictly restricted to internal project distribution). NZZ will also provide the consortium with feedback on the status quo and needs of its current portals, and on new prototypes developed by the consortium. The newspaper will be given access to improved text after the application of automatic OCR post-correction and enriched newspaper content following the use of text mining tools. NZZ will also participate actively in workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians) and text miners exchange views.
**Participants**: Ruth Haener (Head of the Archive and Services Department), André Maerz (Project Manager for Convergence).
