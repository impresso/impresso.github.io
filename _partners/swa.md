[// www.ub.unibas.ch](http://www.ub.unibas.ch/en/ub-wirtschaft-swa/schweiz-wirtschaftsarchiv/allgemeines/) &mdash;  The SWA (Schweizerisches Wirtschaftsarchiv), founded in 1910, maintains business archives and document collections on specific topics, companies, associations and individuals. The focus of the SWA collections includes Swiss economic policy and economic development and the history of Swiss economics and companies. In addition to newspaper clippings, collections include studies, reports, PR material and other publications from companies, associations, official offices and research institutes. A major project currently under way at the SWA revolves around the digitisation of newspaper extracts and some archive documents.

**Role**: SWA will provide optimised access to digitised cultural heritage, newspapers and periodicals in particular. SWA will help to identify opportunities for the improvement of existing portals and to identify and serve user needs, and give feedback on prototypes developed by the consortium. SWA will participate in project workshops and benefit from enriched newspaper content as well as the availability of open-source prototypes.

**Participants**: Irene Amstutz (Head of the University of Economics at the Swiss Economic Archives).
