The History Department has extensive expertise in media history and is actively engaged in research and teaching activities in digital history. In 2006, a [research and teaching centre for the integration of audiovisual sources in contemporary history](https://www.unil.ch/hist/hac) was set up, and collaborations with RTS, SRG SSR and Memoriav were also developed. Since 2011, the Department has been examining the contribution of digital technology to historical research (cf. [transperiod research hub on digital history](https://www.unil.ch/hist/hn)).

UNIL contributes its considerable expertise and networks in media – especially radio – and digital history, carries out several historical case studies, organises international conferences and helps strengthen the links with partner institutions, especially RTS and Memoriav.
