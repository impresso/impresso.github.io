The department has been the leading text technology institution in the German-speaking part of Switzerland for the past 20 years. Its members are experts in machine learning for NLP and have contributed to neural approaches for machine translation, multilingual morphology, normalisation of historical spelling and OCR post-correction. Its activities include interdisciplinary text mining in historical, biomedical, political, social and linguistic projects, and the group has successfully completed projects to build, annotate and query large corpora for various languages. Another focus is cultural heritage engagement by combining human and machine reading for OCR crowd-correction and building a digital letter network of the reformer Heinrich Bullinger.

UZH contributes its machine learning expertise in text technology for annotating, indexing, aligning and exploiting large multilingual heritage corpora. In particular, it develops transfer-based methods for cross-lingual semantic analysis at word, phrase, paragraph and document level.
