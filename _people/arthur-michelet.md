After earning a Master of Arts in History and Philosophy from the University of Lausanne in 2023 with a dissertation on banking multinationalisation in Switzerland, Arthur now explores Swiss banks’ public relations activities in the latter half of the 20th century. Benefitting from expertise in economic history and political philosophy, his PhD research is aimed at intertwining media and financial history, so as to unravel external influences on media ecosystems and their impact on the shaping of public support for banks’ private interests in the context of Swiss direct democracy.

Within *impresso*, Arthur provides one of the historical case studies, contributes to the co-design of the *impresso* web app and data lab as well as to the project’s dissemination efforts.
