After an MA in History and Philosophy with a dissertation on the global expansion of Swiss multinational banks, Arthur now explores the relation of banks and media ecosystems. His doctoral research focuses on the history of the Swiss Bankers’ Association’s public relations and the mass-media coverage of Swiss banks in the 20th century.

Within *impresso*, Arthur provides one of the historical case studies, contributes to the co-design of the *impresso* web app and data lab as well as to the project’s dissemination efforts.
