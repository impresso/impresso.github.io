Benoît Seguin is an Independent Engineer specialized in the applications of Machine Learning with a specific expertise with applying technology to large data coming from the Cultural Heritage domain.

Within the first Impresso project, he developed two experimental components: First, a prototype for a visual search engine that allows users to search within the pictures and iconographic elements of the impresso collection and explore them by similarity. Second, a recommender system that allows users to calibrate the weight of temporal proximity, named entities, topics and text reuse.
