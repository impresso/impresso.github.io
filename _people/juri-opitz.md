Juri is a researcher interested in machine learning, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and computational linguistics. He obtained his Ph.D. from Heidelberg university, where he explored metrics between structured representations of text and their applications. Generally, he likes to study representations and their ability to meaningfully capture data (e.g., text, images, etc.).

Within Impresso, Juri is mainly working with [Simon](/people/simon-clematide/) and [Andrianos](/people/andrianos-michail/) to refine the semantic search capabilities within the collection and investigate representations of heterogeneous and mixed texts like the ones we encounter in Impresso.
