Oleksandra Kunovska Mondoux completed her Ph.D. in contemporary history at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland). Her doctoral thesis dealt with the representations of globalization, modernization and consumption in newspaper advertisements of Ukrainians, Jews, and Poles in interwar Lviv. During her doctoral research, she created a database of more than 40,000 advertisements in interwar Poland to examine the common features of daily life in a multi-ethnic city as well as the power of economic nationalism and trade wars. Oleksandra has experience in various academic milieus and international organisations. Her research interests include global, social, economic, gender, quantitative and visual history.

Within *impresso*, Oleksandra will research how gender and ethnic identities reveal consumption practices in newspaper advertisements of different geographic spaces and cultural traditions. She will also examine how trade with Eastern Europe is perceived in Swiss newspapers and what marketing strategies Eastern European entrepreneurial businesses applied in order to conquer Swiss markets.
