We are thrilled to announce a major release of the impresso interface for the exploration of historical newspapers.

<!-- more -->

The interface is freely available at [impresso-project.ch/app](https://impresso-project.ch/app/)

Access to the full corpus requires a signed non-disclosure agreement (template available on the website __LINK?__).

<span style="color:#CCC">## About the project:

<span style="color:#CCC">impresso. Media Monitoring of the Past is an interdisciplinary research project in which a team of computational linguists, designers and historians collaborate on the datafication of a multilingual corpus of digitized historical newspapers. The primary goals of the project are to improve text mining tools for historical text, to enrich historical newspapers with (semi-) automatically generated data and to integrate such data into historical research workflows by means of a newly developed user interface.

<span style="color:#CCC">The ambition for the interface is to facilitate the critical exploration of historical texts; to make it possible to search, extract, process, link and explore archive data from digitised newspapers. impresso is designed to integrate text mining into historical research workflows with special attention to query building in an iterative manner and driven by the principles of transparency and generosity.

Currently, impresso covers the period 1738 - 2018 and gives access to a corpus of 76 Swiss and Luxembourgish newspapers in partnership with the National Libraries of Switzerland and Luxembourg, Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ), Le Temps, State Archives of Valais, Swiss Economic Archives as well as the University of Lausanne and infoclio.ch.

## Main features:

+ Inspect & Compare offers an overview of and comparison of user-generated collections and queries to reveal (dis)similarities between them.
+ N-gram viewer reveals word frequencies over time; fully interoperable with filters for metadata, entities and topics.
+ Graph-based topic model explorer helps to identify relevant and related topics.
+ Keyword suggestions based on word embeddings point to synonyms and related terms, reveal (historical) spelling variations and frequent OCR misspellings.
+ Content filters based on topic models allow the inclusion or exclusion of specific groups of articles such as "sports", "arts" or "legal" and reveal multiple facets within search results and collections.
+ Content filters based on linked named entities reveal the changing contexts in which entities such as persons, institutions and locations appear across time and newspapers.
+ Image similarity search reveals the distribution of similar images within the corpus but also allows to check if a given image is present in the corpus. A third usage is keyword search in automatically detected image captions.
+ Visualisations of gaps, biases in the corpus and confidence scores for OCR and entities help to better manage user expectations as to what can be found in the corpus and to judge the value of any finds.
+ Article recommendations identify potentially relevant content outside a user's search scope and are based on topic modeling.
The following components will be released in the coming months:
+ Exploratory interfaces for text reuse clusters, n-grams and topics reveal patterns across time and newspapers and assist query-building.
+ Additional article recommendations based on metadata, named entity recognition and text reuse.
