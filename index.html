  summary: How can newspapers help understand the past? How to explore them?
<!--headline: Historical newspapers are mirrors of past societies. Published over centuries on a regular basis, they record wars and minor events, report on international, national and local matters, and document the day-to-day life. In short, they keep track of the great and small history.-->

    Starting in 2023, we will build a Western European corpus, integrate newspaper and radio sources, and enable data-driven transnational historical research.
    <br>
    We thank the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) for their trust and await formal approval by the Luxembourgish Fonds National de la Recherche (FNR).
    <br>
We are excited and honoured to collaborate with a range of old and new partners.

    <p>The objective of the project "Media monitoring of the past. Mining 200 years of historical newspapers" is to enable <b>critical text mining of newspaper archives</b> with the implementation of a technological framework to extract, process, link, and explore data from print media archives. Supported by an <a href='/consortium'>interdisciplinary consortium</a> composed of computational linguists, digital humanists, designers, historians, librarians and archivists, <i>impresso</i> (i.e. “what has been printed”) will tackle the challenges of <b>content enrichment</b> and <b>data representation, visualization and analysis</b>, completed by <b>methodological and epistemological reflections</b>. Expected outcomes include, among others,  a set of natural language processing (NLP) tools dedicated to historical print media, visualization interfaces for active exploration and critical analysis of newspaper corpora in a transparent manner, as well as a digital history research project on resistance to European unification in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. </p>

    <p> <b>Time frame</b>: September 2017 - August 2020 </p>
    <p> <b>Funding</b>: Swiss National Science Foundation </p>

<!--<p>Historical newspapers represent a wealth of archival material which offer a daily account of the past. If newspaper archives are currently undergoing mass digitization, much remains to be done in order to provide an extensive and sophisticated access to the information they contain. The aim of the project "Media monitoring of the past. Mining 200 years of historical newspapers" is to critical text mining of newspaper archives with the implementation of a technological framework to extract, process, link, and explore data from media archives. Supported by an interdisciplinary consortium featuring researchers from computer sciences and humanities, it will tackle the challenges of content enrichment, data representation, visualization and analysis, completed by methodological and epistemological reflections.</p>-->

<!--<p>For long held on library and archive shelving, newspapers are currently undergoing mass digitization, and millions of facsimiles, along with their machine-readable content acquired via Optical Character Recognition, are becoming accessible via a variety of online portals. If this represents a major step forward in terms of preservation of and access to documents, much remains to be done in order to provide an extensive and sophisticated access to the content of these digital resources.-->
