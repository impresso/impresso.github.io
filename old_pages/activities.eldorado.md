From manual, on-site exploration of microfilm or paper collections to online keyword search over millions of OCRized page, access to digitized newspapers has changed significantly. Coupled with automatic enrichment of sources via text and image processing, this represents a whole world of new possibilities. An Eldorado? Despite undeniable merits, the digital transformation and the new affordance of historical newspapers also brings some drawbacks and possible pitfalls which need to be carefully assessed. The Eldorado workshop, supported by the impresso project, brought together a group of historians, librarians, computer scientists and designers to discuss how digitisation is changing historical research practices. Proceedings of the online event will be published in an edited volume with De Gruyter.
