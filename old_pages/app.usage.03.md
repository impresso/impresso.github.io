## _impresso_ challenges - how to become an _impresso_ power user

Based on concrete examples, the _impresso_ challenges offer a step-by-step and hands-on guidance through the application. The first challenge introduces the interface features, to make the most of the search tools offered by the application: how to read the frequency lines, how to use topics and named entities as filters, and how to explore the _impresso_ corpus. The second challenge introduces some digital source criticism elements to help you understand the limits inherent to such a digital corpus and its automatically extracted information. Finally, the third challenge proposes to explore the _impresso_ corpus with a more abstract perspective, to illustrate the operationalisation of research questions via the interface features.
