"Oh, that's what you mean!" During our discussions, we realized chances are that one uses terms that others do not know, or understand differently. We therefore decided to gradually collect, across domains, all sorts of terms related to the production, processing and exploitation of digital historical media sources. We hope that the resulting glossary will facilite mutual understanding in interdisciplinary settings around historical print media, and beyond. If you wish to suggest a correction or an addition, do not hesitate to email us.

### ALTO

The Analyzed Layout and Text Object (ALTO) is an open XML standard originally developed by the EU project METAe (2004), and maintained by the Library of Congress since 2010. The goal is to represent information of OCR recognized texts, i.e. to describe text (strings) and layout information (coordinates of columns, lines and words on a page).
