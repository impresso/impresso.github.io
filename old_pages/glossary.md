« Oh, that's what you mean! » During our discussions, we realised chances are that one uses terms that others do not know, or understand differently. We therefore decided to gradually collect, across domains, all sorts of terms related to the production, processing and exploitation of digital historical media sources. We hope that the resulting glossary will facilitate mutual understanding in interdisciplinary settings around historical print media, and beyond. If you wish to suggest a correction or an addition, do not hesitate to email us.
