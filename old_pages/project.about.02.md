The first *impresso* project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF CR- SII5_173719) as part of the Sinergia funding programme. It developed a scalable architecture for the processing of Swiss and Luxembourgish newspaper collections and created the [*impresso* web application](https://impresso-project.ch/app/)  with powerful search, filter, and discovery functionalities based on semantic enrichments which targeted the historical research community at-large.
