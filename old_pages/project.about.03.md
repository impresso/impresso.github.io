The second *impresso* project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF 213585) and the Luxembourg National Research Fund (17498891) as part of the Sinergia / INTER funding programmes. It puts forward the vision of a comprehensive connection between media archives across modalities, time, languages, and national boundaries. Since 2023, we are working together with Western European partners to build, enrich, integrate, and analyze a corpus of historical newspaper and radio sources. To this end, the [project team](/consortium) pursues discipline-specific yet intertwined [research objectives in natural language processing](/project/linguistics/), [design](/project/design/), and [history](/project/history/).

The project produces, amongst other outputs, interfaces for the exploratory and data-driven study of historical media, resources, models, and system architecture for the processing and enrichment of historical documents, and original historical research under the umbrella theme of “influences”.

We thank the [Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://www.snf.ch/en) and [Luxembourgish Fond National de la Recherche (FNR)](https://www.fnr.lu/) for their continued trust. We are excited and honored to collaborate with a range of old and new partners.
