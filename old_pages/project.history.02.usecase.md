This case study involved an analysis of debates on the European idea in digitised newspapers from Luxembourg, Switzerland and beyond, with the aim of identifying tensions around the European idea from the late 19th century to the 1950s. It used the *impresso* tools to research an aspect of those debates that has received little attention: resistance to Europe. The lack of previous research on this question is undoubtedly related to the complex sources required.

*impresso* addressed this blind spot, prompting methodological reflections and raising the question of how we can make newspapers a valuable source for examining public opinion in the 19th and 20th centuries. The growth in newspaper production and circulation, together with the rise in freedom of speech in Europe, means that newspapers are particularly appropriate for this purpose.

Researchers have been investigating the history of the European idea, including the period before the creation of todayâ€™s European institutions, for the past few decades. A new trend has emerged over the past ten years, focusing on resistance to European integration in the 20th century. Much is therefore known about views on European unification within intellectual circles in the 19th and 20th centuries, whereas the history of anti-European opinions and activism is restricted to the late 20th century, partly because of difficulties in pinpointing these views outside the forum of structured movements. This research project aims to draw on new research tools to analyse newspapers and optimise their potential for examining the issue of anti-European trends.
