To achieve our goals, we are guided by five key concepts:

1. **Vectorization:** Creating numeric embeddings for linguistic and visual content to facilitate semantic representations.

2. **Cross-lingual Alignment:** Ensuring comparable semantic representations for different languages and media types.

3. **Contextualization:** Enhancing linguistic content with contextualized embeddings and linking out to external resources for richer context.

4. **Aggregation and Abstraction:** Applying hierarchical clustering to provide meaningful grouping for exploration and visualization.

5. **Relevance Assessment:** Computing scores for the centrality of entities and concepts to determine their importance in historical documents.

Through these concepts, we aim to provide accessible and powerful tools for historians and researchers, enriching the exploration of historical data and fostering new insights.
