    <p>From a <a href="https://impresso-project.ch/project/linguistics/">computational linguistics perspective</a>, we carried our the semantic indexation of huge volumes of scanned texts via the adaption and application of a variety of natural language processing techniques, allowing humanities scholars to understand and interpret their contents. From a <a href="https://impresso-project.ch/project/history/">historical perspective</a>, the driving question was how such semantic enrichments could support search and discovery of sources and their critical analysis. For the <a href="https://impresso-project.ch/project/design/">design team</a> finally, this created the challenge to develop a public-facing interface which integrates the semantic enrichments in novel search and discovery workflows.</p>
