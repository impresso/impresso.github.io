_impresso_ develops two types of interfaces to access our data.

## 1. _impresso_ web app

The [_impresso_ web app](https://impresso-project.ch/app/) offers a graphical user interface for exploration and the compilation of research datasets. It builds on the application developed during the first _impresso_ project. As part of the second project, the web app is revised to facilitate access to different types of historical media, such as audio recordings, and various types of text, e.g., typescripts, transcribed speech, or radio programming schedules.

## 2. _impresso_ data lab

The forthcoming _impresso_ data lab is an infrastructure for data access and annotation services via APIs, along with their integration in executable Jupyter notebooks. The data lab will provide researchers with examples based on experiments with data-driven analyses of the _impresso_ corpus. Annotation services offer access to semantic indexing models and the ability to relate external data to the corpus.
