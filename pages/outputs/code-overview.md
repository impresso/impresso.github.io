A significant amount of code is being produced by the Impresso team, from data preparation to front-end interface including semantic enrichment, indexing, infrastructure, API and notebooks. The code is released under an open licence on GitHub at [github.com/impresso](https://github.com/impresso), and documented through the forthcoming “impresso cookbook”.
