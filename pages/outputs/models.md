This page provides an overview of the models developed by the Impresso team, which are used for various tasks such as text recognition, semantic enrichment, and data analysis. The models are designed to enhance the processing and understanding of digitised newspaper content and they are available on Hugging Face at [huggingface.co/impresso-project](https://huggingface.co/impresso-project).
