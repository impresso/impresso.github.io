This Privacy Notice explains how the _impresso_ project may process your personal data and the rights you are entitled to.

### 1. About

**About this notice.** This Privacy Notice provides general information that applies in various situations, e.g.:

- whether you register as a user of the _impresso_ interface or API;
- when you participate to an event organised by the \_impresso \_project;
- when you register to the _impresso_ mailing list;
- when you participate in a survey conducted by the _impresso_ project.

**About the _impresso_ project.**“_impresso_ - Media Monitoring of the Past II. Beyond Borders: Connecting Historical Newspapers and Radio” (“_impresso_”) is a research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant No. CRSII5_213585) and the Luxembourg National Research Fund (grant No. 17498891).

_Impresso_ aims to enable the joint exploration of newspaper and radio archive contents across time, language and national borders by co-designing and developing an open and generic technological framework for the seamless exploration of semantically connected media archives across languages. The project develops natural language processing techniques to enrich the media archives with semantic annotations and to advance digital history research and methods. _Impresso_ designs, implements and provides access to a Graphical User Interface (“interface”) and an Application Programming Interface (API) to explore, visualise and compare vast amounts of historical print and audio collections.

_Impresso_ receives high-quality media archive collections from partner cultural heritage institutions (national libraries, archives, media institutions or newspapers) across Europe. Together, these collections form the _impresso_ corpus.

### 2. Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data?

The _impresso_ project is carried out by a consortium of four universities:

- École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland;
- Institut für Computerlinguistik of the Universität Zürich (UZH), Zürich, Switzerland;
- University of Luxembourg (C<sup>2</sup>DH), Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg;
- Université de Lausanne Unicentre (UNIL), Lausanne, Switzerland.

These partners are joint data controllers and processors of the personal data that is collected in the context of the activities of the _impresso_ project.

### 3. Legal basis for data processing

The _impresso_ project collects and processes your personal data in accordance with the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regards to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter “GDPR”) and/or the Federal Act on Data Privacy of 25 September 2020 (“_Loi fédérale sur la protection des données_” (LDP), RS 235.1), as the case may be.
