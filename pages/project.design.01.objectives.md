**Interfaces for the exploration and analysis of enriched and integrated historical media**

To facilitate research on our data, we develop two research-oriented user interfaces: the *impresso* web app, a powerful graphical user interface, and the *impresso* data lab, developed around a user-oriented API. The design of both interfaces is informed by case studies and associated user needs, including transparency requirements. This to ensure a robust foundation for infrastructure and data sustainability and to establish a central hub for the creation of a research community around our corpus and interfaces.

**The *impresso* Web App for source exploration**

The web app builds on the application developed during the first *impresso* project and merges traditional functionalities like keyword and faceted search with innovative features for exploring the enriched corpus. Its key functionalities are:

- **Corpus Overview:** Presenting contextual information on source provenance, data enrichment, and high-level overviews of corpus composition including different types of text (newspapers, typescripts, transcribed speech) and audio recordings.

- **Search and Filtering:** Enabling advanced operations for enriched media sources across modalities, time, and modalities based on metadata and semantic enrichments.

- **Content Retrieval and Exploration:** Integrating data visualization, content viewers, and audio players for seamless transitions between close and distant reading.

- **Comparative Perspectives:** Offering advanced comparative views on research data collections, supporting the discovery of patterns and facilitating content-based similarity ranking and recommendation.

- **Seamless Integration:** Ensuring smooth integration with the *impresso* data lab for efficient research workflows.

**The *impresso* Data Lab for computational analysis**

The *impresso* data lab offers access to our corpus, enrichments, and tools by providing a dedicated API that also offers document annotation services. This will constitute a transparent and versatile framework for data-driven comparative analysis of internal and research-specific external documents. Overall, the data lab will offer the following services:

- **API Accessibility:** Opening the corpus, enrichments, and tools for programmatic exploitation.

- **Dynamic Research Workflows:** Experimenting with modular, dynamic, and personalized research workflows to bridge the gap between digitized collections and data-driven historical research.

- **Annotation Service:** Enabling the enrichment of user-provided documents by project-based NLP components, supporting e.g. topic models, named entity recognition, keyphrase extraction, and vectorized representations.

- **Enrichment Import:** Allowing users e.g. to import external enrichments of project documents and empowering researchers to work with self-generated topics in the interface.

The user-oriented API will provide convenience modules for programmatic exploitation of data and enable researchers to process the projectâ€™ corpus and enrichments along with other documents and using (external) libraries relevant to their research needs.
