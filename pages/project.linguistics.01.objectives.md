The project produced a **historical media monitoring tool suite that bridged the semantic gap** between huge volumes of scanned text and humanities scholars willing to understand and interpret its content.

The main objective of the tool suite is to **overcome the current limitations of state-of-the-art keyword-based methods and to enable new search and discovery capabilities**. The suite is composed of a series of natural language processing (NLP) components that process historical print media texts and store the extracted information in a knowledge base (KB), along with the original texts and facsimiles. As well as being open source, it is also modular, in order to meet the needs of different user groups, and interoperable, so that it can be integrated into third-party tools or frameworks.
More specifically, the developed text mining tools allows users to perform **search and filter functions in the lexical and semantic spaces of single words and multi-word expressions, the referential space of entities and the conceptual space of topics/categories of pages and documents**, while taking into account the temporal dimension that cuts across all these levels and the different languages present in our collection.

At the lexical-semantic level, moving beyond traditional n-gram counts, enables users to examine how a word has changed its meaning through time and investigate how a concept is expressed in different languages, while also suggesting relevant synonyms and variants. At the entity level, the tool suite can be used to look for a specific person, place or institution and its contexts and associated information, as well as to explore aggregated views of such entities, for example how often they occur in texts at a specific time and with which other entities they are regularly mentioned. At the conceptual level, the objective is to enable the exploration of article topics, namely their definition and distribution over different sources and through time. All three levels are jointly leveraged through a faceted search function. Finally, we also provide recommendations, i.e. the ability to look for semantically related items (words, entities or articles).
