Leveraging  an unprecedented corpus of newspaper and radio archives, ***impresso* - Media Monitoring of the Past** is an interdisciplinary research project that uses machine learning to pursue a paradigm shift in the processing, semantic enrichment, representation, exploration, and study of historical media across modalities, time, languages, and national borders.

There are two *impresso* projects with the second building on top of the first, albeit with expanded scope and ambitions.

## The first *impresso* project (2017-2020)

The first *impresso* project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF CR- SII5_173719) as part of the Sinergia funding programme. It developed a scalable architecture for the processing of Swiss and Luxembourgish newspaper collections and created the [*impresso* web application](https://impresso-project.ch/app/)  with powerful search, filter, and discovery functionalities based on semantic enrichments which targeted the historical research community at-large.

## The second *impresso* project (2023-2027)

The second *impresso* project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF 213585) and the Luxembourg National Research Fund (17498891) as part of the Sinergia / INTER funding programmes. It puts forward the vision of a comprehensive connection between media archives across modalities, time, languages, and national boundaries. Since 2023, we are working together with Western European partners to build, enrich, integrate, and analyze a corpus of historical newspaper and radio sources. To this end, the [project team](/consortium) pursues discipline-specific yet intertwined [research objectives in natural language processing](/project/linguistics/), [design](/project/design/), and [history](/project/history/).

The project produces, amongst other outputs, interfaces for the exploratory and data-driven study of historical media, resources, models, and system architecture for the processing and enrichment of historical documents, and original historical research under the umbrella theme of “influences”.

We thank the [Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://www.snf.ch/en) and [Luxembourgish Fond National de la Recherche (FNR)](https://www.fnr.lu/) for their continued trust. We are excited and honored to collaborate with a range of old and new partners.

“*impresso* - Media Monitoring of the Past II. Beyond Borders: Connecting Historical Newspapers and Radio” (“*impresso*”) funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF 213585) and the Luxembourg National Research Fund (17498891), [https://impresso-project.ch](https://impresso-project.ch).

What can we do with yesterday’s news? Historical newspapers are mirrors of past societies. Published over centuries on a regular basis, they record wars and minor events, report on international, national and local matters, and document day-to-day life. They reflect the political, social and economic contexts in which they were produced and help us understand how people in the past experienced their time. In recent years, newspapers were mass-digitised and are now readily available for consultation online. Keyword search remains the most popular way to find interesting articles - but is there a better way?

The Swiss-Luxembourgish project impresso. Media Monitoring of the Past thinks there is and uses text mining tools to extract, process, link and visualise information from Luxembourgish and Swiss newspapers. This allows us for example to track the mentions of specific persons and places over time, to explore thematics such as sports or culture and to detect reused text passages across newspapers. To access and explore all this newly generated data we developed a new user interface and a range of didactic materials which help to foster a better understanding of the advantages and challenges of digitisation.
