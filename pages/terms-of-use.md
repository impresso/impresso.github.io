## 1. About

**Impresso Project. **“_impresso_ - Media Monitoring of the Past II. Beyond Borders: Connecting Historical Newspapers and Radio” (“_impresso_”) is a research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF 213585) and the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR).

_Impresso_ aims to enable the joint exploration of newspaper and radio archive contents across time, language and national borders by co-designing and developing an open and generic technological framework for the seamless exploration of semantically connected media archives across languages. The project develops natural language processing techniques to enrich the media archives with semantic annotations and to advance digital history research and methods. _Impresso_ designs, implements and provides access to a Graphical User Interface (“interface”) and an Application Programming Interface (API) to explore, visualise and compare vast amounts of historical print and audio collections.

_Impresso_ receives high-quality media archive collections from partner cultural heritage institutions (national libraries, archives, media institutions or newspapers) across Europe. Together, these collections form the _impresso_ corpus.

**Terms of Use. **These Terms of Use (ToU) define the conditions of use of the Data and services available to web users (‘Users’) through the _impresso_ interface and API.

_Impresso_ reserves the right to modify the ToU at any time in order to adapt them to changes in laws and regulations or to new functions that may be offered by publishing new releases of the _impresso_ corpus, interface or API. The date of the last update of the ToU is indicated on the first line of this document.

## 2. Data accessible through the _impresso_ interface and API.

There are three types of Data available through the _impresso_ interface and API:

### 1. Media Archives\*\*, that is:

- fac-similes (images) of newspapers or radio magazines;
- audio records of radio programmes;
- text transcriptions of fac-similes and audio record recognised via optical character recognition (OCR) or automatic speech to text (ASR) techniques.

### 2. Newspaper and Radio Collection Metadata\*\* (“Metadata”)

that is descriptive (e.g. title, dates, place of publication), structural (issue, page, content items), and administrative (file timestamps, file creator, preservation metadata) metadata. The metadata is provided by cultural institutions and in most cases completed by the _impresso_ team (either technical or descriptive metadata).

### 3. Semantic Annotations \*\*correspond to various types of structured information and computational representations extracted or computed from the collections by the Impresso project.

Semantic annotations include, for example, the output of linguistic pre-processing, word embeddings, OCR quality assessment, n-grams, named entity mentions and entities, topics and topic models, text re-use clusters and passage and image visual signatures.

## 3. SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE IMPRESSO INTERFACE AND API.\*\*

The _impresso_ interface and API allow Users to search, browse, explore and compare the content of Media Archives, their Metadata and Semantic Annotations free of charge.

It is specified that Media Archives, Metadata and Semantic Annotations are subject to various copyrights and intellectual property rights held by _impresso_ or its partners and that Users, in the course of their authorised access, accept responsibility for the appropriate handling and management of the data in accordance with these Terms of Use.

**Data and services accessible to Users are the following:**

1. **Users without an impresso interface account **can use all the features of the interface (search, filter, visualise, explore, compare, etc.) on Media Archives that fall under the category of access and use "Public Domain" (see below), and on all metadata and semantic annotations.
2. **Users with an impresso interface account **can use all the features of the interface (search, filter, visualise, explore, compare, etc.) on Media Archives that fall under the category of access and use "Public Domain" and “Academic Use”, and on all metadata and semantic annotations. They can additionally create and export collections.
3. **Users with an impresso API account **can use all the features of the API on Media Archives that fall under the category of access and use "Public Domain" and “Academic Use”, and on all metadata and semantic annotations. They can additionally create and export collections. An impresso API account is limited in time.

**4. CONDITIONS FOR OPENING AN IMPRESSO ACCOUNT BY USERS**

In order to open an Interface or API Account, the User must complete the online registration form by providing the following information: last name, first name(s) and email address. Once the form has been completed and validated by the User, a confirmation email will be sent to the email address provided in the form, inviting the User to activate his/her interface or API account. Once the account has been activated, the User will receive his/her credentials (login/password or API token) and will be able to authenticate and use the services of the _impresso_ interface or API.

The opening of an account by a User is free of charge. The User undertakes to provide accurate, complete and up-to-date personal information. It is strictly forbidden to create an account using a false identity, a pseudonym or in a fraudulent manner.

In the event that the User uses his/her account, login details or the data and content accessible on the interface or via the API in violation of these Terms of Use, he/she may be held liable under civil and/or criminal law.

**5. CONDITIONS OF USE OF THE DATA**

Media Archives, Metadata and Semantic Annotations are subject to various copyrights and intellectual property rights held by _impresso_ or its partners.

**Media Archives. **With respect to Media Archives**,** _impresso_ has received permission from cultural heritage institutions and rights holders to put their works on the internet via an interface and an API, provided that you, as a User, adhere to these terms of use.

There are two Categories of Access and Use\*\* \*\*associated with the Media Archives accessible through the _impresso_ interface and API:

1. **Public Domain**: for all Media Archive data that is in the public domain, no restrictions apply. For the avoidance of doubt, Public Domain Media Archive data refers to data that is ineligible for copyright protection or whose copyright has expired and is therefore freely available to everyone. Within the _impresso_ interface and API, this data is labelled as “Public Domain”. Users shall respect best academic and scientific citation practices as specified in Section 6.
2. **Academic Use**: for all Media Archive data that is still under copyright and not in the public domain, only academic, educational and personal use is permitted. Academic Use include the following:

- Users are permitted to use Media Archive data for academic research and educational purposes, or as part of their personal activities. This includes the right to save or print digital documents.
- Users may cite digital documents in publications (e.g. dissertations, scientific publications) and other dissemination activities (e.g. scientific presentations, blogs or websites, social media) as specified in Section 4.
- Users may download up to 10,000 (ten thousand) Media Archive items per institution consisting of textual transcriptions and semantic annotations (no images, no audio recordings);
- Users are not allowed to mass-download digital documents without permission.
- Users are not allowed to redistribute digital documents;
- Users are not allowed to use digital documents for commercial purposes.

  Any other use of the copyrighted material requires permission from the copyright holder(s).

The Category of Access and Use of Media Archive data item(s) is indicated at the issue level for newspapers, and at the program level for radio collections. This information is available in several views in the interface and upon download or query. Users must check the copyright status of documents before any use.

If uncertain about the Category of Access and Use of Media Archive data item(s) or if there is no clear indication of this, the User must treat the item(s) as if it were of “Academic Use” and discuss any questions he/she has with a representative of the _impresso_ project.

**Newspaper and radio collection metadata** Except mentioned otherwise, all newspaper metadata material is free of use, under a CC BY 4.0 licence.

**Semantic annotations** are visible through the _impresso_ interface and used as facets mainly. They are also part of the content that users can export as CSV or access via the API. Furthermore, they will also be released at the end of the project as datasets. In all their forms and if not specified otherwise, semantic annotations are under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence.

**4. CITATION OF DATA.**

Users shall cite digital items in accordance with standard academic and scientific practice and with [Article 25](https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920251/index.html#a25) of the Swiss Federal Act on Copyright and Related Rights. In particular, citations of Media Archive data item(s) should always include their archive owner and the impresso interface URL if they are found and accessed through it.

**5. PERSONAL DATA**

The _impresso_ project collects personal data from registered Users of the interface in accordance with its **Privacy Notice**, which can be downloaded and accessed from the interface [[LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ztNKgc_c-ZGz3p0ftJKcmJ6h4tu2wn11a0EC2nHPEk/edit)].

**6. SIGNATURE.**

The User's acceptance to the ToU is by means of a clickwrap in which the User agrees to and accepts the ToU. This acceptance is considered an original signature.

**7. APPLICABLE LAW.**

The terms of use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland. The exclusive place of jurisdiction shall be Lausanne, Switzerland.

_Impresso_ makes newspapers available as cultural and historical sources, in the form in which they appeared at the time. Furthermore, any information (media archives, metadata, semantic annotations) on this website is provided as is, without guarantee of completeness or correctness.

_Impresso_ project and its associated cultural heritage partners assumes no liability for the use of media archives, metadata, and semantic annotations from its collections by users or third parties. Users or third parties free _impresso_ and its partners of any claim addressed to it by third parties, in particular concerning the violation of intellectual property rights or personality rights arising from the use of such documents.

\_Impresso \_is a research project that aims to experiment with new ways of exploring and enriching media archives. The content accessible through the interface and the API (media archives, metadata, semantic annotations) may therefore change during different releases. Users agree not to hold impresso liable for the deletion or modification of content provided through the interface and API.
